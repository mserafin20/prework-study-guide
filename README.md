# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

The motivation behind this project was to get an early start and become familiar with the couse material we'll be studying these next 6 months. I built this project to aid my study process, while at the same time solving the issue of keeping all the information organized. The biggest thing I've learned from this prework project is to not get frustrated when an error message pops up, but to backtrack and try to find the issue. Majority of the time it's a small fix that wasn't worth getting frustrated about anyways.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
